# mesh_for_m_6
The mesh used in Local Wall Cooling Effects on Hypersonic Boundary-Layer Stability journal paper.

The grid used in this study is shared in GitHub along with the density, velocity, and energy variables of the solution file for the adiabatic case without wall cooling. The mesh consists of 64 pieces which corresponds to 64 different outputs of parallel cores. Each mesh file has ten element long common layer. The single document is not uploaded because of the size limitation of the GitHub.
